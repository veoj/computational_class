This is the final exam of computational class.
The problem is about the temperature and efficency of light bulb, it is the question on textbook (page285, problem 6.18)

In part a, i calculate the value of efficency as a function of temperature, the plot is shown in final_a.png
I use Romberg Integraton to calculate the integral.

In part b, I calculate the temperature of maximum efficiency by using Gauss Newton method.

In part c, i discussed whether the temperature is practical for a tungsten filament light bulb, this part is included in the jupyter notebook (the b-and-c one.)
