This one is about projectile motion with air resistance.
There are three different cannonballs, Pb, Pu and Nd.
The distance is calculated.


The derivation of part (a) is shown in derivation.pdf


The code for part (b) and part (c) is shown in JingSun_Midterm.py, 
also, the jupyter notebook is also uploaded (JingSun_Midterm.ipynb).
The plot is shown in projectile_motion.png

Pu is the farest, and the explanation is shown in derivation.pdf
