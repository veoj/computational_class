This assignment is about nonlinear pendulum.

In part (a), the angle of displacement is calculated by using Runge-Kutta method.

In part (b), the angle of displacement is calculated by using Leapfrog method.

In part (c), it's the animation of a pendulum, l=0.19 m, standstill at 174 deg.
To run this code, vpython must be installed first.
I can only run this in jupyter notebook. I tried to run it in terminal, but the vpython doesn't work in terminal.
The code(.py) and notebook(.ipynb) is all uploaded.
I tried, but still couldn't figure out how to save the output as a .gif file.
So the animation can only be seen in the jupyter notebook.....for now.....or maybe forever....
And also, honestly, I don't think the animation is showing the right pendulum motion....
